# Chapter 1 Pilot

In a small town nestled in the rolling hills of the countryside, there lived a group of talking cows who were unlike any other. These cows could communicate with each other in human speech and even had their own unique personalities.

One day, the leader of the talking cows, a wise old cow named Martha, gathered her herd together for an important announcement.

"My fellow cows," Martha began, her deep voice carrying through the meadow. "It is time for us to find our first job in the human world."

The other cows mooed in agreement, eager to explore the world beyond their peaceful pasture. They set out on their journey, walking upright like humans, their hooves clopping against the pavement.
