# Chapter 4
To their surprise, the ghostly figure smiled, its ethereal form shimmering in the moonlight.

"Congratulations, talking cows," the ghost said. "You have passed our test. You have shown courage and bravery in the face of fear, and for that, you shall be rewarded."

And with that, the mansion vanished into thin air, leaving the talking cows standing in the empty field under the starlit sky.

From that day on, the talking cows became known as the heroes of the town, their tale of bravery and supernatural encounters passed down through generations. And as they returned to their pasture, they knew that they had found their true calling in the human world â€“ to protect and serve, no matter the cost.

Their courage and legend continued to grow, inspiring everyone.
