# Chapter 3 Bessie is scared
As they entered the bustling town, the talking cows were met with curious stares and whispers from the townspeople. But undeterred, they made their way to the local job fair, where they hoped to find employment.

After hours of wandering through the fair, the talking cows finally stumbled upon a help-wanted sign at a creepy old mansion on the outskirts of town. The sign read: "Wanted: Night-time security guards. Must have a strong stomach and be willing to work in the dark."

Excited at the prospect of their first job, the talking cows eagerly applied for the position. To their surprise, they were hired on the spot by the mysterious owner of the mansion, a reclusive old man named Mr. Grimshaw.
