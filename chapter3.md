# Through the Black
That night, the talking cows reported for duty, patrolling the mansion's dark and eerie corridors. As they made their rounds, they heard strange noises coming from the attic and the basement, sending shivers down their spines.

After hours of wandering through the fair, the talking cows finally stumbled upon a help-wanted sign at a creepy old mansion on the outskirts of town. The sign read: "Wanted: Night-time security guards. Must have a strong stomach and be willing to work in the dark."

Just then, a ghostly figure appeared before them, its hollow eyes staring into their souls. The talking cows froze in fear, their hearts pounding in their chests.

But martha, the fearless leader of the herd, stepped forward, her voice steady.
