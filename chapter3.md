# Chapter 2 Martha is scared
As they entered the bustling town, the talking cows were met with curious stares and whispers from the townspeople. But undeterred, they made their way to the local job fair, where they hoped to find employment.

After hours of wandering through the fair, the talking cows finally stumbled upon a help-wanted sign at a creepy old mansion on the outskirts of town. The sign read: "Wanted: Night-time security guards. Must have a strong stomach and be willing to work in the dark."

Just then, a ghostly figure appeared before them, its hollow eyes staring into their souls. The talking cows froze in fear, their hearts pounding in their chests.

But martha, the fearless leader of the herd, stepped forward, her voice steady.
